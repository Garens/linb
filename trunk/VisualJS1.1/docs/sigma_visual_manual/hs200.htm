<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, times, roman, serif" SIZE="3">A Sigma Visual UI web page could contains several components, such as buttons, tabs, drop down list. Some controls will be child controls to other, for example a button within a panel is a child to this panel . Thus, we have a structure - where any object you work with is in some hierarchical relation to some other object.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, times, roman, serif" SIZE="3">The structure dropdown tree shows the hierarchy of components in web page(within design view).&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, times, roman, serif" SIZE="3">Structure is shown in a tree-view like display. Try clicking on something in the tree item. Note how various parts on the "form" get selected.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, times, roman, serif" SIZE="3">If you have an object on a form and click it, its properties and events are displayed in the Object Inspector. Sometimes, you could not select a component by cliking because that at one point components are crowed. *Structure Dropdown Tree* is another approach to select component. In the figure above, you can get components alias named treegrid3 selected by simply clicking on *treegrid3* item.
