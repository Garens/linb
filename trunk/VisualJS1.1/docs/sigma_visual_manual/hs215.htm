<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, times, roman, serif" SIZE="3">If you have some experience on MS Visual Basic or Borland Delphi, you could be familiar some words like property and event. If you don't, you need 5 minutes to know what they mean.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, times, roman, serif" SIZE="3"><B>Properties</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, times, roman, serif" SIZE="3">In Sigma Visual, properties are features of a web component by modifying which developer can change component's features and behaviors. Many Sigma Linb components have common properties. Most all visual components, for example, have a Height and a Width property. These two properties control how bigger area the component will cover on a web page both at design time and at runtime.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, times, roman, serif" SIZE="3"><B>Events</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, times, roman, serif" SIZE="3">Sigma Visual is aimed to build up an event-driven environment for Ajax developer. Events include mouse movements, mouse clicks, and key presses. Because different components have different feature for different purpose, Sigma Linb components wrap all the movements, clicks and presses. Event will be fired only in some special case, for example, when end-user clicks on a special area within a tree grid component.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, times, roman, serif" SIZE="3"><B>Alice Name</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, times, roman, serif" SIZE="3">In Sigma Visual, all the components have a property named *Alice Name*. This property, *Alice Name*, is very important to any application. It specifies the name of the component as code reference. When you add a component on web page by dragging, Sigma Visual will provide a default *Alice Name* for the component, for example, label1, button1. You are suggested to give your components a meaningful *Alice Name* before writing the code that refers to them. You can do this by changing the value of the*Alice Name* in the *Object Inspector*.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, times, roman, serif" SIZE="3">On the left side of the web page is the component inspector. In this inspector, you can modify a component's properties and events. The component inspector has two sections: a dropdown list and a tree grid. Dropdown list contains many items standing for components on the page. Tree grid contains one item saying properties and one item saying events. Click plus in front of properties item, you will see several property entries. Click plus in front of events item, you will see several event entries. The list of properties &amp; events available varies from component to component.</FONT><BR>
